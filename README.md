## About
This OS is made by some Russian guys

## Building
You will need: **Linux or WSL2**
1. Install docker engine following this tutorial for Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ NOTE: Another distros are supported as well, but the installation steps are different.
2. Go into project folder and start ./buildenv.sh
3. After building, it opens enviroment console (next time when you start this script it starts very fast)
4. Execute `make build` and wait, when it completes
5. Make creates ISO image in build folder

P.S. For further updates, you can simply run `git pull` and then repeat steps 2-5.
If the build is not successful after the update, try running `make clean`, and then try building again.
